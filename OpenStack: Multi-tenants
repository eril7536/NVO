Auto Scaling Application : Openstack libraries can be used in Python to create connection with Openstack controller. We need to create a YAML file to authenticate
the user. The format of the YAML file is -

clouds:
  <user>:
    region_name: <region_name>
    auth:
      username: 
      password: 
      project_name: 
      project_domain_name: 
      user_domain_name: 
      auth_url: http://192.168.56.34/identity/
    log_file: /tmp/openstackclient_admin.log
    log_level: debug
